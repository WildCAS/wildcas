          Welcome to WildCAS!
        </h3>

        <p>
          WildCAS is an open source project to create an intuitive web journal
          for students of the International Baccalaureate program to satisfy the
          CAS requirement. The project is currently in heavy development so there
          isn't a hosted version of this app yet.
        </p>

        <h3>
          <a id="intuitive" class="anchor" href="#intuitive" aria-hidden="true">
            <span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
          </a>
          Intuitive
        </h3>

        <p>
          A specialized web journal should not be complicated. Students should
          be able to login, reflect, and live. The app is designed to make the
          learning curve of the CAS program and its associated software low.
        </p>

        <h3>
          <a id="transparent" class="anchor" href="#transparent" aria-hidden="true">
            <span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
          </a>
          Transparent
        </h3>

        <p>
          The student should be able to go in and reflect, without having
          distractions from the app. Thus, allowing for a deeper and more honest
          reflection.
        </p>

        <h3>
          <a id="helpful" class="anchor" href="#helpful" aria-hidden="true">
            <span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
          </a>
          Helpful
        </h3>

        <p>
          Students should know where they are lacking and which requirements
          they have not met. Their attention should be placed on furthering the
          understanding of themselves. Coordinators and advisers should not have
          to deal with the logistical nightmares of account administration,
          because that's the software's job.
        </p>

        <h3>
          <a id="secure" class="anchor" href="#secure" aria-hidden="true">
            <span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
          </a>
          Secure
        </h3>

        <p>
          Student's reflections are highly personal, no one else needs to see
          the student's reflections except for coordinators and advisers.
        </p>
