The project is currently in heavy development so there isn't a hosted version of this app yet. \r\n\r\n### Intuitive\r\nA specialized web journal should not be complicated. Students should be able to login, reflect, and live. The app is designed to make the learning curve of the CAS program and its associated software low.\r\n\r\n### Transparent\r\nThe student should be able to go in and reflect, without having distractions from the app. Thus, allowing for a deeper and more honest reflection. \r\n\r\n### Helpful\r\nStudents should know where they are lacking and which requirements they have not met. Their attention should be placed on furthering the understanding of themselves. Coordinators and advisers should not have to deal with the logistical nightmares of account administration, because that's the software's job. \r\n\r\n### Secure\r\nStudent's reflections are highly personal, no one else needs to see the student's reflections except for coordinators and advisers. \r\n\r\n### Open\r\nOur code base is open sourced and licensed under Apache 2.0. Anyone is free to poke around and play with our code.",
